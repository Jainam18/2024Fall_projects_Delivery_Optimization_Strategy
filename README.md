**Topic -- Enhancing Logistic Delivery Strategies with Monte Carlo Simulation**


In any logistic company, they have strategies to combact various scenarios, like for example, they know that during Christmas the order volume is high so they need to be ready with higher number of vechicles than usual.
Our project is about how external factors affect the number of on time deliveries and time taken to deliver orders. We have formulated 2 hypothesis to test two different scenarios.

Hypothesis 1-
"Two smaller trucks(B) running simultaneously will deliver more number of packages on time as compared to one larger truck(A) in a day."


Hypothesis 2- 
"The total time taken for completing deliveries is less using the travelling salesman problem route optimization approach than greedy route strategy but the as the number of deliveries volume increases the travelling sales problem approach takes a lot of computation time"

The following are assumptions that we have made -
1. We have assumed that the logistic company in a day works from 8am - 5pm i.e. 8 hrs.
2. We have assumed there is no priority assigned to the order deliveries and each of the order have same priority levels
3. We have assumed that there are no accidents, road partitions or natural disasters taking place
4. We have assumed the season has no effect on the speed to reach a location.
5. We have assumed that big truck speed is 10kph less than small truck speed.
