    "The results of this project indicate that two smaller trucks (B) working simultaneously are consistently more effective at delivering packages on time per day compared to one larger truck (A), particularly as the number of orders increases, supporting the Null Hypothesis. While the TSP approach (utilizing the larger truck) achieves better delivery times, it comes at a significantly higher computational cost. On the other hand, the Greedy approach (using smaller trucks) is more computationally efficient, making it a more practical solution for larger delivery volumes where computation time becomes a critical factor. Therefore, while the Alternate Hypothesis holds true for smaller delivery volumes where computation cost is less significant, the Null Hypothesis proves to be more practical and scalable for larger volumes due to its computational efficiency and reliability in meeting delivery demands."
