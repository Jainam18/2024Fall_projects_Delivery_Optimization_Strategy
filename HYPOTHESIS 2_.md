HYPOTHESIS 2

"The total time taken for completing deliveries is less using the travelling salesman problem route optimization approach than greedy route strategy but the as the number of deliveries volume increases the travelling sales problem approach takes a lot of computation time"

Greedy approach - Out of X number of delivery points, we will consider the point nearest to the hub as first delivery location. Then after delivering on first location, out of X-1 delivery points, we will consider the next nearest point from the current location of vehicle( which would be 1st delivery points)

Random variables-
1. Traffic Congestion
2. Delivery locations
3. Speed variability
