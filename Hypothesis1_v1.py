# Initializing the street network
def initialize_graph(place_name):
    '''
    Initializes the street network graph for a region and then sets speed and travel time properties to  the graph.

    The function retrieves the network graph for a location and then sets time and speed to the graph.We have assumed that Truck A's speed is 16 kph slower than Truck B's, but no lower than 16 kph.
    

    Args:
        place_name (str): The name of the place to generate the street network graph. example-"Champaign"

     Returns:
        networkx.MultiDiGraph: A graph representing the street network with speed and travel time attributes.
